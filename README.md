# SmallWebSocketDemo

This is a small demonstration to showcase the real-time capabilities of WebSockets. It's designed for use in a school research project or for educational purposes.

## Getting Started

To run the demo locally, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node .
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the demo.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the demo by opening multiple browser tabs or windows and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This will simulate multiple users connected to the WebSocket server.

The demo includes features such as:

- Sending and receiving real-time messages between connected users.
- Selecting users to send messages to.
- Real-time updates of connected users list.
